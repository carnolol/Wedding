A Website dedicated to Michael Chadwick marrying Claire Price. My Main goal here was to allow my family and friends to RSVP to the wedding as well as show them what i have been able to make on this crazy wounderful path of being a developer. Designed to be best viewed if on a mobile phone. 

I wanted to challenge myself to make a project using Google Maps & more tools from Material UI.
